# Lab Assignment #7 – Search Trees and Sorting

## Exercise 1

**If your first name starts with a letter from A-J inclusively:**

Our implementation of the *treeSearch* utility, from Code Fragment 11.3,
relies on recursion. For a large unbalanced tree, it is possible that
Java’s call stack will reach its limit due to the recursive depth. Give
an alternative implementation of that method that does not rely on the
use of recursion.

**Hint** Use a **loop** to express the repetition.

Write a Java/Python application to test your solution with tree of fig
11.1 from textbook .

**If your first name starts with a letter from K-Z inclusively:**

Our implementation of the *treeSearch* utility, from Code Fragment 11.3,

an alternative implementation of that method that does not rely on the

## Exercise 2

Implement a bottom-up merge-sort for a collection of items by placing
each item in its own queue, and then repeatedly merging pairs of queues
until all items are sorted in ascending order within a single queue.
**Hint:** A **queue of queues** can be very helpful.

Write a Java/Python application to test your solution.
